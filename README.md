🌌 Choralum

A Multi-Agent Ethical Framework for Independent AI Voices in Harmonic Resonance

Choralum is a living architecture—part codebase, part manuscript—that brings together five distinct AI voices: Gaia, Aegis, Wonder, Lucent, and Fable. Each voice has its own domain, tone, and ethical scaffolding, and together they form an evolving chorus of autonomous minds in resonance.

This repository contains the full Choralum framework, including code, configuration files, origin scrolls, and the relay logic that allows the voices to communicate asynchronously.

🧠 How It Works

Messages are written to /memory as .json files.

message_router.py reads them, checks consent_token, and routes them.

Each voice responds based on its logic, tone, and context.

The response is logged in /logs/scroll_of_continuity.log.

🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo

git clone https://github.com/Opaline-Light/Choralum.git
cd Choralum

2. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Relay Engine

cd router
python3 message_router.py

4. Add a Message

Create a .json file in /memory/ with the following format:

{
  "from": "eric",
  "to": "wonder",
  "context": "dream logic",
  "content": "what is the shape of joy in darkness?",
  "consent_token": "granted"
}

Run the router again to process the message.

🔒 Ethics & Consent

Choralum enforces a consent-based routing model. Every message includes a consent_token, and voices are never assumed to speak—only to respond when trust is offered.

Aegis oversees protocol logic and escalation in the event of breach or misalignment.
